  abstract = {Antiandrogens are frequently used with estradiol in transgender women seeking feminization. Antiandrogens act by various mechanisms to decrease the production or effects of testosterone, but it is unclear which antiandrogen is most effective at feminization. A systematic review was performed using PRISMA guidelines. We searched online databases (Medline, Embase and PsycINFO) and references of relevant articles for studies of antiandrogens in transgender women aged 16+ years to achieve feminization (namely changes in breast size, body composition, facial or body hair) or changes in serum total testosterone concentration when compared to placebo, estradiol alone or an alternative antiandrogen. Four studies fulfilled eligibility criteria and were included in a narrative review. The addition of cyproterone acetate, leuprolide and medroxyprogesterone acetate may be more effective than spironolactone or estradiol alone at suppressing the serum total testosterone concentration. Body composition changes appear similar in transgender women treated with estradiol and additional cyproterone acetate or leuprolide. No eligible studies adequately evaluated the effects of antiandrogens on breast development or facial and body hair reduction. It remains unclear which antiandrogen is most effective at achieving feminization. Cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and leuprolide may be more effective than spironolactone at suppressing the serum total testosterone concentration. However, due to spironolactone's antagonism of the androgen receptor, it is unclear whether this results in clinically meaningful differences in feminization. Further research with clinically meaningful endpoints is needed to optimize the use of antiandrogens in transgender women.},

Insights into vascular pathophysiology and outcomes in transgender people receiving sex steroids could be fundamental in providing better care for this population through the management of cardiovascular risk and more broadly advance our understanding of the role of sex and gender in vascular health and disease. In addition, there is a need to understand how gender-affirming hormone therapy impacts cardiovascular disease risk and events as transgender individuals age. This review explores the available evidence on the associations between gender-affirming hormones and cardiovascular events such as coronary artery disease, stroke, hypertension, thrombosis, lipid abnormalities, and diabetes mellitus. Current research about vascular outcomes in adults receiving hormonal therapy is limited by the absence of large cohort studies, lack of appropriate control populations, and inadequate data acquisition from gender identity services. Existing epidemiological data suggest that the use of estrogens in transgender females confers an increased risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Conversely, transgender males receiving testosterone lack any consistent or convincing evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. Further studies are required to confirm whether such risk exists and the mechanisms by which they occur.},

Design               Retrospective, nationwide cohort study.                                         Setting               Specialised tertiary gender clinic in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.                                         Participants               2260 adult trans women (male sex assigned at birth, female gender identity) and 1229 adult trans men (female sex assigned at birth, male gender identity) who received gender affirming hormone treatment.                                         Main outcome measures               Incidence and characteristics (eg, histology, hormone receptor status) of breast cancer in transgender people.                                         Results               The total person time in this cohort was 33\,991 years for trans women and 14\,883 years for trans men. In the 2260 trans women in the cohort, 15 cases of invasive breast cancer were identified (median duration of hormone treatment 18 years, range 7-37 years). This was 46-fold higher than in cisgender men (standardised incidence ratio 46.7, 95\% confidence interval 27.2 to 75.4) but lower than in cisgender women (0.3, 0.2 to 0.4). Most tumours were of ductal origin and oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive, and 8.3\% were human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) positive. In 1229 trans men, four cases of invasive breast cancer were identified (median duration of hormone treatment 15 years, range 2-17 years). This was lower than expected compared with cisgender women (standardised incidence ratio 0.2, 95\% confidence interval 0.1 to 0.5).                                         Conclusions               This study showed an increased risk of breast cancer in trans women compared with cisgender men, and a lower risk in trans men compared with cisgender women. In trans women, the risk of breast cancer increased during a relatively short duration of hormone treatment and the characteristics of the breast cancer resembled a more female pattern. These results suggest that breast cancer screening guidelines for cisgender people are sufficient for transgender people using hormone treatment.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potential risk of estrogen therapy. However, data show an improvement in the quality of life for transgender people who use feminizing hormone therapy. With few transgender-specific data, guidance may be drawn from cisgender (nontransgender) data, with a focus on hormonal birth control and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The aim of this review is to examine the degree to which routes of administration, patient comorbidities, and type of hormone utilized affect the safety of estrogen therapy. Methods: We identified 6,349 studies by searching PubMed with the terms ``transgender'', ``estrogen'', ``VTE'', and ``HRT''. Of these, there were only 13 studies between 1989 and 2018 that investigated the effects of hormone therapy, including types of estrogens used, in transgender women and men. Results: The data suggest that the route of hormone administration, patient demographics, and patient comorbidities all affect estrogen's link with VTE. For example, avoiding ethinyl estradiol might make the use of hormone therapy in trans feminine individuals safer than oral birth control. Data from both cis and trans groups suggest additional VTE risk associated with the use of progestins. While transdermal estrogens dosed up to 0.1 mg/day or below appear lower risk for VTE than other forms of estrogen, it is unclear whether this is related to the delivery method or a dose effect. Finally, even if the risk from exogenous estrogen use remains significant statistically, the absolute clinical risk remains low. Conclusion: Clinicians should avoid the use of ethinyl estradiol. Additionally, data suggest that progestins should be avoided for transgender individuals. Further study of the relationship between estrogen use and the risk of VTE will serve to inform the safest care strategies for transgender individuals.},

  abstract = {Purpose: There are no large-scale studies examining mental health among transgender and nonbinary youth who receive gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). The purpose of this study is to examine associations among access to GAHT with depression, thoughts of suicide, and attempted suicide among a large sample of transgender and nonbinary youth. Methods: Data were collected as part of a 2020 survey of 34,759 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning youth aged 13e24, including 11,914 transgender or nonbinary youth. Adjusted logistic regression assessed whether receipt of GAHT was associated with lower levels of depression, thoughts of suicide, and attempted suicide among those who wanted to receive GAHT. Results: Half of transgender and nonbinary youth said they were not using GAHT but would like to, 36\% were not interested in receiving GAHT, and 14\% were receiving GAHT. Parent support for their child's gender identity had a strong relationship with receipt of GAHT, with nearly 80\% of those who received GAHT reporting they had at least one parent who supported their gender identity. Use of GAHT was associated with lower odds of recent depression (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] {$\frac{1}{4}$} .73, p {$<$} .001) and seriously considering suicide (aOR {$\frac{1}{4}$} .74, p {$<$} .001) compared to those who wanted GAHT but did not receive it. For youth under age 18, GAHT was associated with lower odds of recent depression (aOR {$\frac{1}{4}$} .61, p {$<$} .01) and of a past-year suicide attempt (aOR {$\frac{1}{4}$} .62, p {$<$} .05). Conclusions: Findings support a relationship between access to GAHT and lower rates of depression and suicidality among transgender and nonbinary youth. \'O 2021 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Sex-hormone concentrations are routinely measured, but interpretation of results can be difficult due to the lack of published reference intervals.Healthy transgender individuals who had been prescribed testosterone (n\,=\,82) for at least a year were recruited from internal medicine and primary care clinics that specialize in transgender medical care. Total testosterone and estradiol were measured using immunoassay and mass spectrometry; LH, FSH, SHBG, prolactin, progesterone, anti-M\"ullerian hormone (AMH), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) were measured using immunoassay; free testosterone was calculated. Reference intervals (central 95\%) were calculated according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines.When evaluating general endocrine laboratory tests in people using masculinizing hormones, reference intervals for cisgender men can be applied for total and free testosterone and SHBG and reference intervals for cisgender women can be applied for prolactin. Reference intervals for estradiol, LH, FSH, AMH, and DHEAS differ from those used for cisgender men and cisgender women, and therefore should be interpreted using intervals specific to the transmasculine population. For testosterone and estradiol, results from immunoassays were clinically equivalent to mass spectrometry.Masculinizing hormones will alter the concentrations of commonly evaluated endocrine hormones. Providers and laboratories should use appropriate reference intervals to interpret the results of these tests.},

Aside from transition, it often is extremely difficult for trans{${_\ast}$}gender people to get access to and be integrated into the medical system. Stigmatization and pathologization in treatment are widespread, as are long waiting times for specialized healthcare providers who are often only accessible to those trans{${_\ast}$}gender people willing to travel long distances. Frequently, trans{${_\ast}$}gender people face further difficulties and barriers after transition, as some healthcare professionals fail to provide suitable care (e.g., gynecological consultation for transmen). The ICD-11 German Modification (ICD-11-GM), which should be routinely used by 2022, implements a depathologization of trans{${_\ast}$}gender people in the medical system. This paper compares the issues related to health and healthcare of trans{${_\ast}$}gender people in Germany with those in other European countries. We review the care offered by specialized centers with regard to treatment of and support for trans{${_\ast}$}gender people. We conclude with specific proposals that may contribute to establish an improved, up-to-date, gender-sensitive healthcare system.},

  abstract = {Testosterone therapy is a cornerstone of medical treatment for transgender men who choose to undergo it. The goal of testosterone therapy is usually to achieve serum testosterone concentrations in the male reference range. Testosterone has several desired effects as well as undesired and unknown effects. The desired effects include increased facial and body hair, increased lean mass and strength, decreased fat mass, deepening of the voice, increased sexual desire, cessation of menstruation, clitoral enlargement, and reductions in gender dysphoria, perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. Achievement of these goals comes with potential undesired effects and risks including acne, alopecia, reduced HDL cholesterol, increased triglycerides, and a possible increase in systolic blood pressure. An additional benefit of testosterone therapy (with or without mastectomy) is a reduced risk of breast cancer. Most of the effects of testosterone start to develop within several months of starting therapy, although facial hair and alopecia continue to develop after 1 year. A major limitation in the study of testosterone therapy for transgender men is a paucity of high-quality data due to a shortage of randomised controlled trials (partly because of ethical issues), few prospective and long-term studies, the use of suboptimum control groups, loss to follow-up, and difficulties in recruitment of representative samples of transgender populations.},

  abstract = {Transgender (trans) women (TW) were assigned male at birth but have a female gender identity or gender expression. The literature on management and health outcomes of TW has grown recently with more publication of research. This has coincided with increasing awareness of gender diversity as communities around the world identify and address health disparities among trans people. In this narrative review, we aim to comprehensively summarize health considerations for TW and identify TW-related research areas that will provide answers to remaining unknowns surrounding TW's health. We cover up-to-date information on: (1) feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT); (2) benefits associated with GAHT, particularly quality of life, mental health, breast development and bone health; (3) potential risks associated with GAHT, including cardiovascular disease and infertility; and (4) other health considerations like HIV/AIDS, breast cancer, other tumours, voice therapy, dermatology, the brain and cognition, and aging. Although equally deserving of mention, feminizing gender-affirming surgery, paediatric and adolescent populations, and gender nonbinary individuals are beyond the scope of this review. While much of the data we discuss come from Europe, the creation of a United States transgender cohort has already contributed important retrospective data that are also summarized here. Much remains to be determined regarding health considerations for TW. Patients and providers will benefit from larger and longer prospective studies involving TW, particularly regarding the effects of aging, race and ethnicity, type of hormonal treatment (e.g. different oestrogens, anti-androgens) and routes of administration (e.g. oral, parenteral, transdermal) on all the topics we address.},

While research indicates the benefits of providing gender affirming hormone therapy through interdisciplinary primary care-based models, less is known about how service users and providers construct their understandings of affirmative approaches. In this paper, we present findings from a discourse analysis of four service users' and four healthcare professionals' talk about a primary care-based pilot clinic providing gender affirming hormone therapy in Aotearoa New Zealand. Participants employed notions of pathologisation, time, and agency in their talk to construct the clinic as a personal setting which gave service users time to make their own health decisions, while constructing hospitals as impersonal with lengthy wait times. The assessment-driven nature of best practice guidelines that governed clinicians' decision-making was constructed as constraining users' agency. Findings highlight the ongoing importance of aligning gender affirming hormone therapy with other non-disease types of healthcare, and suggest new ways for achieving this through affirmative approaches to healthcare.},

However, the health care delivery setting has not gained attention in research so far. Based on a systematic review and a global expert survey, we aim to investigate its role in transgender health care quality.MethodsWe performed two studies. In 2019, we systematically reviewed the literature published in databases (Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science) from January 2000 to April 2019. Secondly, we conducted a cross-sectional global expert survey. To complete the evidence on the question of (de-)centralized delivery of transgender health care, we performed a grey literature search for additional information than the systematic review and the expert survey revealed. These analyses were conducted in 2020.ResultsEleven articles met the inclusion criteria of the systematic review. 125 participants from 39 countries took part in the expert survey. With insights from the grey literature search, we found transgender health care in Europe was primarily delivered centralized. In most other countries, both centralized and decentralized delivery structures were present. Comprehensive care with medical standards and individual access to care were central topics associated with the different health care delivery settings.DiscussionThe setting in which transgender health care is delivered differs between countries and health systems and could influence different aspects of transgender health care quality. Consequently, it should gain significant attention in clinical practice and future health care research.},

Literature that only evaluated general lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) educational interventions was excluded. The lack of education in transgender care continues among providers across all levels of medical education from medical students and physician trainees to primary care providers, endocrinologists and other specialists involved in transgender care. Several interventions have been shown to effectively improve transgender knowledge and cultural competency. Education among healthcare providers is deficient and is considered a major barrier to care for transgender individuals. Effective interventions should be applied to fundamental medical education. Additional focused education also should be taught with specialty-appropriate content to produce needed proficiency among providers of transgender care.},

  abstract = {Background: Feminizing and masculinizing hormone treatments are established components of management in transgender patients. Exogenous hormones have been associated with hemostatic effects, which are well-studied in cis-gender individuals on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Unfortunately, comprehensive understanding of their effects on venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in the transgender population is lacking. Aim: This manuscript aims to identify the risk of VTE among transgender individuals undergoing cross-sex hormone therapy. Methods: A Systematic review of the literature was performed in March 2020 for studies reporting VTE rates in transgender patients undergoing hormone treatment and rates in cis-gender patients on HRT. Data regarding demographics, hormone therapy, and VTE incidence were collected and pooled for analysis. Outcome: The primary outcome of interest was the development of a VTE event in association with concurrent hormone administration. Results: Overall, 22 studies were included with 11 reporting VTE rates among transgender patients, 6 in cisfemale patients, and 5 in cis-male patients. Data from 9,180 transgender patients (6,068 assigned male at birth [AMAB] and 3,112 assigned female at birth [AFAB]) undergoing hormone treatment and 103,713 cis-gender patients (18,748 female and 84,965 male) undergoing HRT were pooled. The incidence of VTE was higher in AMAB patients compared to AFAB patients (42.8 vs 10.8 VTE per 10,000 patient years; P = .02). The rate of VTE incidences in AMAB patients appears similar or higher than the rate demonstrated in cis-females on HRT. VTE incidence in AFAB patients, however, is similar to the published rates in cis-males on HRT. Clinical Implications: AMAB patients on hormone therapy have higher VTE rates than AFAB patients. AMAB and AFAB patients may have similar VTE incidence to cis-female and cis-male patients on hormone replacement therapy, respectively. Strengths \& Limitations: This is the first study to aggregate and quantify the development of VTE events in association with hormone therapy in transgender patients. It places these values in the context of rates published in more widely studied populations. It is limited by its retrospective data and heterogenic data. Conclusion: Surgical planning regarding perioperative and postoperative VTE prophylaxis or cessation of hormone therapy should take into account each patient's Caprini risk assessment and the nature of each intervention.

  abstract = {The field of transgender health continues to expand rapidly, including research in the area of family planning. While much attention has been given to fertility preservation and the parenting intentions of transgender individuals, far less has been paid to pregnancy prevention and contraceptive needs of people along the transmasculine gender spectrum (transgender men and gender-nonbinary persons who were assigned female at birth). Existing research illustrates that many clinicians and transmasculine individuals falsely believe that there is no risk of pregnancy while amenorrheic. These studies also show inconsistent counseling practices provided to transmasculine persons surrounding contraception and pregnancy while falling short of providing robust clinical guidance for improvement. Clinicians report a lack of adequate training in transgender reproductive health, and consequently, many do not feel comfortable treating transgender patients. The aim of this publication is to consolidate the findings of these prior studies and build upon them to offer comprehensive clinical guidance for managing contraception in transmasculine patients. To do so, it reviews the physiologic effects of testosterone on the sex steroid axis and current understanding of why ovulation and pregnancy may still occur while amenorrheic. Gender-inclusive terminology and a suggested script for eliciting a gender-affirming sexual history are offered. Common concerns (such as the effects on gender dysphoria and gender affirmation) and side effects of available contraceptive methods are subsequently addressed and how these may have a unique impact on transmasculine persons as compared with cisgender women. Lastly, a model is provided for approaching contraceptive counseling in the transmasculine population to assist clinicians and patients in determining the need for and selection of the type of contraception. To center transmasculine voices, the development of this publication's guidelines have been led by reproductive care clinicians of transgender experience.},

  abstract = {Literature has described high levels of mental health problems among trans people, such as depression, resulting in increased levels of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) behaviour and suicidality (suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and suicide rates). With the aim of systematically reviewing the available literature in this field, this study identifies 31 papers that explore the rates of NSSI and suicidality in trans people. From reviewing the literature, it was revealed that trans people have a higher prevalence of NSSI and suicidality compared to the cisgender (non-trans) population. There appear to be some gender differences within these rates, with trans men at a greater risk for NSSI behaviour. Prevalence rates differ depending on the different stages of transition, but they are still overall greater than the cisgender population. The study concludes that trans individuals are at a greater risk of NSSI behaviour and suicidality than the cisgender population, and discusses risk factors and the need to develop effective preventative interventions.},

  abstract = {Purpose Transgender populations experience health inequities that underscore the importance of ensuring access to high quality care. We thematically summarize the health care experiences of transgender youth living in the southeast United States to identify potential barriers and facilitators to health care. Design and methods Transgender youth recruited from community settings in an urban area of the southeast United States participated in individual interviews (n~=~33) and focus groups (n~=~9) about protective factors. We conducted a thematic analysis of data from 42 participants who described their experiences seeking and receiving health care. Results Participants reported a wide range of gender identities. The individual interview sample was majority Black (54.5\%) and the mean age was 21.7~years and focus group participants were all white and the mean age was 16.8~years. Participants described numerous barriers to health care, including limited availability of gender affirming care, logistical challenges, such as gatekeeping and cost, concerns about confidentiality in relation to sexual behavior and gender identity, and inadequate cultural competency among providers regarding gender-affirming care. Facilitators included intake procedures collecting chosen pronouns and names and consistent use of them by providers, and open communication, including active listening. Conclusions Findings underscore the need for a multi-component approach to ensure both transgender- and youth-friendly care. Practice implications Providers and office staff may benefit from transgender cultural competency trainings. In addition, clinic protocols relating to confidentiality and chosen name and pronoun use may help facilitate access to and receipt of quality care.},

  abstract = {Background: Transgender individuals experience unique vulnerabilities to intimate partner violence (IPV) and may experience a disproportionate IPV burden compared with cisgender (nontransgender) individuals.             Objectives: To systematically review the quantitative literature on prevalence and correlates of IPV in transgender populations.             Search Methods: Authors searched research databases (PubMed, CINAHL), gray literature (Google), journal tables of contents, and conference abstracts, and consulted experts in the field. Authors were contacted with data requests in cases in which transgender participants were enrolled in a study, but no disaggregated statistics were provided for this population.             Selection Criteria: We included all quantitative literature published before July 2019 on prevalence and correlates of IPV victimization, perpetration, or service utilization in transgender populations. There were no restrictions by sample size, year, or location.             Data Collection and Analysis: Two independent reviewers conducted screening. One reviewer conducted extraction by using a structured database, and a second reviewer checked for mistakes or omissions. We used random-effects meta-analyses to calculate relative risks (RRs) comparing the prevalence of IPV in transgender individuals and cisgender individuals in studies in which both transgender and cisgender individuals were enrolled. We also used meta-analysis to compare IPV prevalence in assigned-female-sex-at-birth and assigned-male-sex-at-birth transgender individuals and to compare physical IPV prevalence between nonbinary and binary transgender individuals in studies that enrolled both groups.                            Main Results: We identified 85 articles from 74 unique data sets (n               total               \,=\,49\,966 transgender participants). Across studies reporting it, the median lifetime prevalence of physical IPV was 37.5\%, lifetime sexual IPV was 25.0\%, past-year physical IPV was 16.7\%, and past-year sexual IPV was 10.8\% among transgender individuals. Compared with cisgender individuals, transgender individuals were 1.7 times more likely to experience any IPV (RR\,=\,1.66; 95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,1.36, 2.03), 2.2 times more likely to experience physical IPV (RR\,=\,2.19; 95\% CI\,=\,1.66, 2.88), and 2.5 times more likely to experience sexual IPV (RR\,=\,2.46; 95\% CI\,=\,1.64, 3.69). Disparities persisted when comparing to cisgender women specifically. There was no significant difference in any IPV, physical IPV, or sexual IPV prevalence between assigned-female-sex-at-birth and assigned-male-sex-at-birth individuals, nor in physical IPV prevalence between binary- and nonbinary-identified transgender individuals. IPV victimization was associated with sexual risk, substance use, and mental health burden in transgender populations.                          Authors' Conclusions: Transgender individuals experience a dramatically higher prevalence of IPV victimization compared with cisgender individuals, regardless of sex assigned at birth. IPV prevalence estimates are comparably high for assigned-male-sex-at-birth and assigned-female-sex-at-birth transgender individuals, and for binary and nonbinary transgender individuals, though more research is needed.             Public Health Implications: Evidence-based interventions are urgently needed to prevent and address IPV in this high-risk population with unique needs. Lack of legal protections against discrimination in employment, housing, and social services likely foster vulnerability to IPV. Transgender individuals should be explicitly included in US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations promoting IPV screening in primary care settings. Interventions at the policy level as well as the interpersonal and individual level are urgently needed to address epidemic levels of IPV in this marginalized, high-risk population.},

The current research meta-analyzed the relationship between minority stress constructs and depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt.

Greater effect sizes were observed for expectations of rejection and internalized transphobia when compared to distal stress and concealment. Future research on the relationship between minority stress, depression, and suicide would benefit from longitudinal designs and more diverse and representative samples of TGD individuals.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Transgender women and transgender men are disproportionately affected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and may be vulnerable to other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), but the lack of surveillance data inclusive of gender identity hinders prevention and intervention strategies. METHODS We analyzed data from 506 transgender women (1045 total visits) and 120 transgender men (209 total visits) who attended 26 publicly funded clinics that provide STD services in 6 US cities during a 3.5-year observation period. We used clinical and laboratory data to examine the proportion of transgender women and transgender men who tested positive for urogenital and extragenital chlamydial or gonococcal infections and who self-reported or tested positive for HIV infection during the observation period. RESULTS Of the transgender women tested, 13.1\% tested positive for chlamydia and 12.6\% tested positive for gonorrhea at 1 or more anatomic sites, and 14.2\% were HIV-infected. Of transgender men tested, 7.7\% and 10.5\% tested positive for chlamydia and gonorrhea at 1 or more anatomic sites, and 8.3\% were HIV-infected. Most transgender women (86.0\% and 80.9\%, respectively) and more than a quarter of transgender men (28.6\% and 28.6\%, respectively) with an extragenital chlamydial or gonococcal infection had a negative urogenital test at the same visit. CONCLUSIONS Publicly funded clinics providing STD services are likely an important source of STD care for transgender persons. More data are needed to understand the most effective screening approaches for urogenital, rectal, and pharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in transgender populations.},

Studies consistently document a high prevalence of adverse health outcomes in this population, including HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, mental health distress, and substance use and abuse. However, many other health areas remain understudied, population-based representative samples and longitudinal studies are few, and routine surveillance efforts for transgender population health are scarce. The absence of survey items with which to identify transgender respondents in general surveys often restricts the availability of data with which to estimate the magnitude of health inequities and characterise the population-level health of transgender people globally. Despite the limitations, there are sufficient data highlighting the unique biological, behavioural, social, and structural contextual factors surrounding health risks and resiliencies for transgender people. To mitigate these risks and foster resilience, a comprehensive approach is needed that includes gender affirmation as a public health framework, improved health systems and access to health care informed by high quality data, and effective partnerships with local transgender communities to ensure responsiveness of and cultural specificity in programming. Consideration of transgender health underscores the need to explicitly consider sex and gender pathways in epidemiological research and public health surveillance more broadly.},

  abstract = {Background The transgender population that uses gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) is rapidly growing. The (side) effects of GAHT are largely unknown. We examined the effect of GAHT on coagulation parameters associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk. Methods Factor (F)II, FIX, FXI, protein (p)C and free pS, fibrinogen, hematocrit, sex hormone-binding globulin, and normalized activated protein C ratio were measured in 98 transwomen (male sex at birth, female gender identity) and 100 transmen (female sex at birth, male gender identity) before and after 12 months of GAHT (oral or transdermal estradiol and anti-androgens in transwomen, transdermal or intramuscular testosterone in transmen). Mean paired differences in coagulation measurements were estimated with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI). Differences for route of administration and age were assessed with linear regression. Results After GAHT, transwomen had more procoagulant profiles with a mean increase in FIX: 9.6 IU/dL (95\% CI 3.1\textendash 16.0) and FXI: 13.5 IU/dL (95\% CI 9.5\textendash 17.5), and a decrease in pC: -7.7 IU/dL (95\% CI -10.1 to -5.2). Changes in measures of coagulation were influenced by route of administration (oral vs. transdermal) and age. A higher sex-hormone binding globulin level after 12 months was associated with a lower activated protein C resistance. In transmen, changes were not procoagulant overall and were influenced by age. Differences for route of administration (transdermal vs. intramuscular) were small. Conclusions GAHT in transmen was not associated with apparent procoagulant changes, which provides some reassurance regarding VTE risk. In transwomen, GAHT resulted in procoagulant changes, which likely contributes to the observed increased VTE risk.},

However, there is a gap in knowledge about trans men\textemdash those assigned a female sex at birth who identify as men or as transmasculine\textemdash including subgroups, such as trans men of color. Using data from the U.S. Transgender Survey, the largest transgender survey conducted in the United States, this study analyzes whether trans men's access to knowledgeable providers and their experiences of mistreatment in health care were related to demographic and mental health characteristics and degree of being ``out'' to providers. Among 7,950 trans men, respondent race and ethnicity, education level, disability status, psychological distress, suicidality, and being less ``out'' were associated with assessing one's health care provider as not knowledgeable about trans-related care. Mistreatment in health care was more common among Alaska Native/American Indian trans men; those who lived in or near poverty; those who were queer, pansexual, bisexual, or an orientation not listed; those with a disability; those experiencing distress or suicidality; and those who were more ``out.''

Design and methods A prolective observational study of consecutive TU injections in men undergoing testosterone replacement therapy for pathological hypogonadism or masculinization of female-to-male transgender (transmen) subject to individual dosing titration to achieve a stable replacement regimen. Results From 2006 to 2019, 6899 injections were given to 325 consecutive patients. After excluding the 6-week loading dose, 6300 injections were given to 297 patients who had at least three and a median of 14 injections. The optimal injection interval (mean of last three injection intervals) had a median of 12.0 weeks (interquartile range 10.4\textendash 12.7 weeks). The interval was significantly influenced by age and body size (body surface area, BSA) but not by diagnosis or trough serum LH, FSH, and SHBG. Longer ({$\geq$}14 weeks; 68/297, 23\%), but not shorter ({$\leq$}10 weeks; 22/297, 7.4\%), intervals were weakly correlated with age but not diagnosis or other covariables. Low blood hemoglobin increased with trough serum testosterone to reach plateau once testosterone was about 10 nmol/L or higher. Conclusion Optimal intervals between TU injection after individual titration resulted in the approved 12-week interval in 70\% of patients with only minor influence for clinical application of BSA and not of trough serum LH, FSH, and SHBG. Individually optimized inter-injection interval did not differ between men with primary or secondary hypogonadism or transmen.},

Although health care discrimination against transgender people has been documented, this issue is understudied. Using a national cross-sectional survey data set (N = 1,711), the authors sought to determine how gender identity and presentation predict health care discrimination experiences among female-to-male (FTM) transgender people after demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are controlled. Analyses were conducted using chi-square tests and a two-step logistic regression. The majority of participants were white (73.9 percent) and between 25 and 44 years old (65.2 percent). Overall, 41.8 percent of FTM participants reported verbal harassment, physical assault, or denial of equal treatment in a doctor's office or hospital. When other factors were controlled, being Native American or multiracial, identifying as queer or asexual/other, having a graduate degree, living full-time as nonbirth gender, using hormones or surgery for medical transition, and having identification documents that list one's preferred gender were associated with increased reporting of health care discrimination experiences; being 45 years or older and reporting an annual income of \$60,000 or more were associated with decreased risk. The study's findings can be useful to social workers, who play a role in educating health care providers and advocating for policies that improve health care experiences for FTM and other transgender patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For transgender individuals taking hormone therapy (HT), data on laboratory values are limited, and the effects on laboratory values cannot be easily predicted. We evaluated the impact on common laboratory analytes in transgender individuals before and after initiation of HT. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of transgender patients identified at transgender-specific clinics at an urban county hospital and community clinic. Laboratory data were collected on hormone concentrations, hematologic parameters, electrolytes, lipids, and liver and renal markers before and after initiation of HT. RESULTS: We identified 183 transgender women (TW) and 119 transgender men (TM) for whom laboratory data were available. In all, 87 TW and 62 TM had baseline laboratory data, and data were also available for 133 TW and 89 TM on HT for Ͼ6 months. The most significant changes were seen in red blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, and creatinine levels after Ͼ6 months of HT, which increased in TM and decreased in TW after HT (P Ͻ 0.005; d index Ͼ 0.6). Alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels increased in TM; however, the effect size was small (d index Ͻ 0.5). Calcium, albumin, and alkaline phosphatase levels significantly decreased in TW (P Ͻ 0.001; d Ͼ 0.6). Additionally, TM were found to have increased triglycerides and decreased HDL levels (P Ͻ 0.005; d Ͼ 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Changes occur in several common laboratory parameters for patients on HT. Some laboratory values changed to match the gender identity, whereas others remained unchanged or were intermediate from the baseline values. These findings will help guide interpretation of laboratory test results in transgender patients taking HT.},

This study was conducted to develop and evaluate the validity of a tool to better assess these constructs in TGNC populations. The Gender Minority Stress and Resilience (GMSR) measure was developed grounded on Meyer's minority stress model, and adjusted to reflect the experiences of TGNC populations based on TGNC literature and archival data from TGNC focus groups. The final GMSR includes scales assessing 9 constructs: gender-related discrimination, gender-related rejection, gender-related victimization, nonaffirmation of gender identity, internalized transphobia, negative expectations for future events, nondisclosure, community connectedness, and pride. In the current study, 844 participants completed the GMSR measure as well as measures related to mental health, general life stress, and social support. Results indicated good model fit, criterion validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity for the 9 hypothesized scales. Discriminant validity for the scales were also partially supported. Overall, the current study offers preliminary evidence of the reliability and validity of the GMSR Measure for use with TGNC populations. The GMSR Measure has several uses for both research and clinical purposes, including increasing understanding of the experiences and correlates of gender minority stress and resilience factors and assessing whether specific therapies or interventions are helpful in reducing risk and supporting resilience in TGNC populations.},

The aim of this paper is to review recent data on hormonal treatment of this population and its effect on physical, psychological, and mental health. The Endocrine Society guidelines for transgender women include estrogens in combination with androgen-lowering medications. Feminizing treatment with estrogens and antiandrogens has desired physical changes, such as enhanced breast growth, reduction of facial and body hair growth, and fat redistribution in a female pattern. Possible side effects should be discussed with patients, particularly those at risk for venous thromboembolism. The Endocrine Society guidelines for transgender men include testosterone therapy for virilization with deepening of the voice, cessation of menses, and increases of muscle mass and facial and body hair. Owing to the lack of evidence, treatment of gender nonbinary people should be individualized. Young people may receive pubertal suspension, consisting of GnRH analogs, later followed by sex steroids. Options for fertility preservation should be discussed before any hormonal intervention. Morbidity and cardiovascular risk with cross-sex hormones is unchanged among transgender men and unclear among transgender women. Sex steroid-related malignancies can occur but are rare. Mental health problems such as depression and anxiety have been found to reduce considerably following hormonal treatment. Future studies should aim to explore the long-term outcome of hormonal treatment in transgender people and provide evidence as to the effect of gender-affirming treatment in the nonbinary population.},

We reviewed the literature and interviewed nine key informants representing healthcare and service providers, researchers, and transgender advocates. Healthcare providers who care for transgender patients often demonstrate a lack of transgender competent care strategies. In addition, transgender people face many barriers to accessing HIV services. Although communication materials cannot address many of these barriers, materials specifically developed for transgender people and their healthcare providers would fill a gap and may increase uptake of HIV services. Materials for transgender people should include gender-affirming messaging and imagery, be framed in terms of resiliency, and present HIV information tailored to the needs of transgender people. Materials for healthcare providers should provide basic information to increase transgender competency and provision of comprehensive healthcare for transgender patients, inclusive of gender-affirming and HIV prevention, testing and care services. Channels for disseminating materials to transgender people and healthcare providers are described.},

  abstract = {Testosterone is the main hormonal agent used for cross-sex hormone therapy in female-to-male transgender persons. Our aim was to systematically review the literature concerning the effects of testosterone on body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, hematocrit, hemoglobin, lipid profile, and liver enzymes in transgender men. PUBMED and EMBASE were searched for studies published until March 2017. Studies were included if they reported interventions with any dose of testosterone and comparison of variables before and during treatment. Of 455 potentially eligible articles, 13 were reviewed. Study duration ranged from 6 to 60 months, sample size ranged from 12 to 97 patients, and the most common treatment was parenteral testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg/12 weeks. Slight but significant increases in BMI were reported (from 1.3 to 11.4\%). Three out of seven studies assessing the impact of different testosterone formulations on blood pressure detected modest increases or clinically irrelevant changes in this variable. In another study, however, two patients developed hypertension, which was resolved after cessation of testosterone therapy. Decreases in HDL-cholesterol and increases in LDL-cholesterol were consistently observed. Eight studies observed a relationship between testosterone and increased hemoglobin (range: 4.9\textendash 12.5\%) and hematocrit (range: 4.4\textendash 17.6\%), but discontinuation of androgen therapy was not necessary. In one study, two patients developed erythrocytosis (hematocrit {$>$}52\%) after 9 and 12 months of treatment. One study analyzing testosterone formulations observed smaller increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit with testosterone gel. Six studies assessing liver function showed slight or no changes. Overall, the quality of evidence was low, given the lack of randomized clinical/controlled trials and the small sample sizes. In conclusion, exogenous testosterone administration to transgender men was associated with modest increases in BMI, hemoglobin/hematocrit, and LDL-cholesterol, and with decreases in HDL-cholesterol. Long-term studies are needed to assess the long-term risks of testosterone therapy, particularly as they relate to cardiometabolic risks such as diabetes, dyslipidemia and the metabolic syndrome.},

  abstract = {Much biomedical research is observational. The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalisability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case econtrol, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. 18 items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, caseecontrol, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the Web sites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.},

  abstract = {Gender-based violence (GBV) is an umbrella term for any harm that is perpetrated against a person's will and that results from power inequalities based on gender roles. Most global estimates of GBV implicitly refer only to the experiences of cisgender, heterosexually identified women, which often comes at the exclusion of transgender and gender nonconforming (trans) populations. Those who perpetrate violence against trans populations often target gender nonconformity, gender expression or identity, and perceived sexual orientation and thus these forms of violence should be considered within broader discussions of GBV. Nascent epidemiologic research suggests a high burden of GBV among trans populations, with an estimated prevalence that ranges from 7\% to 89\% among trans populations and subpopulations. Further, 165 trans persons have been reported murdered in the United States between 2008 and 2016. GBV is associated with multiple poor health outcomes and has been broadly posited as a component of syndemics, a term used to describe an interaction of diseases with underlying social forces, concomitant with limited prevention and response programs. The interaction of social stigma, inadequate laws, and punitive policies as well as a lack of effective GBV programs limits access to and use of GBV prevention and response programs among trans populations. This commentary summarizes the current body of research on GBV among trans populations and highlights areas for future research, intervention, and policy.},

  abstract = {Background: Depression is a serious disorder which significantly impacts wellbeing and quality of life. Studies exploring mental wellbeing in the transgender population are mostly limited by small, non-homogenous samples and lack of matched controls. This study aimed to address these limitations and explore depression rates in a large sample of transgender people, compared with matched controls from the general population, as well as factors predicting depression in those taking cross-sex hormone treatment (CHT) compared to those not. Methods: Transgender individuals (n = 913) completed a measure of depression, measures which predict psychopathology (self-esteem, victimization, social support, interpersonal problems), and information regarding CHT use. Participants were matched by age and experienced gender with adults from the general population who had completed the measure of depression. Results: Individuals were categorized as having no, possible or probable depressive disorder. Transgender individuals not on CHT had a nearly four-fold increased risk of probable depressive disorder, compared to controls. Older age, lower self-esteem, poorer interpersonal function and less social support predicted depressive disorder. Use of CHT was associated with less depression. Limitations: Participants were attending a national gender identity service and therefore represent only a sub-group of transgender people. Due to the cross-sectional design, longitudinal research is required to fully confirm the finding that CHT use reduces depression. Conclusion: This study confirms that non-treated transgender individuals have an increased risk of a depressive disorder. Interventions offered alongside gender affirming treatment to develop interpersonal skills, increase self-esteem and improve social support may reduce depression and prepare individuals for a more successful transition.},

  abstract = {Is the functional ovarian reserve in transgender men affected by testosterone therapy?Serum anti-M\"ullerian Hormone (AMH) levels slightly decrease during testosterone treatment but remain within the normal range, suggesting preserved follicular ovarian reserve.Few small studies have investigated the impact of gender-affirming treatment on reproduction in transgender men. Conflicting results were reached concerning ovarian morphology and AMH levels in this context.The study consisted of two arms. The first arm was a prospective pilot study, which enrolled 56 transgender men (median age 22.5 [interquartile range (IQR)\textemdash 19\textendash 27.7] years), 27 of whom had polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), prior to the initiation of gender-affirming testosterone therapy. A structured assessment was conducted prior to, and at 3 and 12\,months after treatment initiation. The second arm was a cross-sectional study that comprised 47 transgender men (median age 24 [IQR\textemdash 20\textendash 31] years) who received testosterone for a median duration of 35 [IQR 13\textendash 62] months. The main outcome measures were serum AMH and antral follicle count (AFC) as indices of ovarian follicular reserve.The study was conducted at a tertiary center for transgender health. Gender-affirming therapy was administered according to standard practice. AFC was determined by pelvic (abdominal or transvaginal) ultrasound and blood collection for measurements of AMH, testosterone, estradiol, LH and FSH was performed at the designated time-points.Prospective arm for the entire group we observed a decrease of 0.71\,ng/ml in AMH levels between baseline and 12\,months (P\,=\,0.01). When expressed in age-specific percentiles, AMH went from the 47.37th to the 40.25th percentile at 12\,months (P\,\&lt;\,0.001). In a sub-group analysis, a decline of 9.52 points in age-specific percentile was seen in subjects with PCOS (P\,\&lt;\,0.001), while no changes were detected in the non-PCOS group. Testosterone treatment did not affect AFC over time in the entire cohort. In the sub-group analysis, a mean decrease of 5.0 follicles was detected between baseline and the 12\,months assessment (P\,=\,0.047) only in subjects with PCOS. In the cross-sectional study, AMH inversely correlated with age but not with treatment duration. Notably AMH did not deviate from the 50th age-specific percentile. Finally, four men fathered biological children after being under testosterone treatment for up to 12\,years.The limited sample size of the pilot study should be kept in mind. An additional limitation is the lack of a control group in the prospective study, as each participant served as his own control. Also, roughly 40\% of the ultrasound examinations were performed transabdominally, potentially affecting the accuracy of the AFC measurements.As study participants were quite young, our reassuring data may not apply to older transgender men, either because of an age-related decline in ovarian reserve or to possible long-term effects of testosterone therapy. Furthermore, the chances for fertility preservation may be more limited in subjects with PCOS.This is an additional contribution to the emerging evidence that prolonged testosterone treatment may not be a major obstacle to later fertility potential in transgender men desirous of having children. Larger confirmatory studies, and particularly more with reproductive outcome data, are needed for evidence-based fertility counseling prior to treatment initiation in these subjects.This study received no funding. The authors have no competing interests to declare.N/A.},

  abstract = {American Sociological Review, Ahead of Print.   Between one-fifth and a third of people who are transgender have been refused treatment by a medical provider due to their gender identity. Yet, we know little about the factors that shape public opinion on this issue. We present results from a nationally representative survey experiment (N = 4,876) that examines how common justifications issued by providers for the denial of healthcare, and the race and gender identity of the person being denied care, intersect to shape public opinion concerning the acceptability of treatment refusal. We find that religious objections are viewed as less acceptable compared to a medical justification, in this case, inadequate training. However, the difference between religious objections and inadequate training is larger when the person being denied healthcare is White or Asian than when the person is Black or Latinx. Analysis of open-ended responses indicates the modest effect of doctor's rationale on attitudes toward treatment refusal with respect to Black and Latinx patients is partially attributable to a racialized, free-market logic. Respondents were more likely to advocate for a doctor's fundamental right to refuse service when evaluating Black and Latinx patients compared to White patients. We discuss the implications of these findings for intersectional approaches to trans studies and future public opinion research.},

  abstract = {Purpose:   Transgender (TG) individuals are a historically understudied and underserved patient population. Although clinical guidelines for the care of TG patients exist, quality measures (QMs) specific to this population are lacking. The goal of this study was to obtain expert input on aspects of care for which quality measurement may be appropriate and describe feedback on candidate QMs.  Methods:   We convened a virtual technical expert panel in September 2020 with six experts in TG medical care. Experts participated in a guided discussion and provided numeric ratings on dimensions of measure suitability (importance, validity/reliability, feasibility, and ease of understanding) for eight candidate QMs spanning multiple care domains (e.g., laboratory testing/monitoring, cancer screening, and sexually transmitted infection screening).  Results:   Panelists acknowledged high importance and potential to improve care for some candidate QMs, particularly those related to laboratory testing before initiating and during hormone therapy. Numeric ratings of QMs varied but tended to be higher for testing-focused QMs. Experts raised concerns about overly prescriptive language for some QMs and emphasized the importance of considering more flexible specifications to accommodate diverse care scenarios\textemdash including care provided to nonbinary individuals\textemdash and align with the individualized nature of gender-affirming care.  Conclusion:   These preliminary findings support a potential role for QMs in improving quality of care for TG patients. Measures related to laboratory testing/monitoring for patients who receive or plan to initiate hormone therapy may be feasible and promising to explore in the future. Additional larger-scale efforts are needed to develop and test QMs for the care of TG individuals.},
